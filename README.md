This repository is built to provide the latest version of the intel compute runtime legacy branch for fedora through COPR. 

This package provides the OpenCL runtime for intel's gen 8 to gen 11 GPUs/iGPUs.

For critical production systems, please use the regular package and not the bleed package. The bleed package is experimental!
